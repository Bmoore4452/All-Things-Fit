# The Home Fit Wellness App


## Description
The Home Fit Wellness App was created for anyone who has wanted to begin a fitness journey but do not like the intimidation of a commercial gym or the excuse of not having the time to go to the gym. Also, with the pandemic many people were not able to go to the gym but they wanted a way to get a good workout in from the comfort of their own home.
